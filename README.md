2. Data processing to normalize each dataset inculding methods - Tokenizing, Lowering case, Stopwords removal, Stemming, Lemmatization.
3. Preparing classification models for each data set using Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and getting the accuracy scores.
4. Evaluation of each of the prediction models against other to review performance against each other.
